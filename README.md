## 1. Description

The "Video Color Replacer Test" project is a small application that allows you to replace a specific color in a video, captured from your webcam, with a small square color of your choice. This project provides a simple and interactive way to experiment with color replacement techniques in real-time video footage. By selecting a target color and defining the replacement color, you can observe the immediate effects of color transformation within the video feed. It offers a fun and creative approach to exploring color manipulation in video streams.
